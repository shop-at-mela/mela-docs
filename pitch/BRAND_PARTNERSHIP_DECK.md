## Brand Partnership Deck

---

## Slide 1: Your Next Growth Market is Waiting

**Mela connects Indian baby fashion brands with diaspora families in the USA**

üöÄ **Founding Partners Program**

### The Opportunity
- **4.5M Indian Americans** with $126K median household income
- **200K+ Indian babies born annually** in the US
- **Zero specialty retailers** for authentic Indian baby products

### Zero Risk Start
‚ú® No listing fees | üéØ Ready customers | üìà Performance-based

---

## Slide 2: The Problem You're Facing

### Selling to the US market is hard and expensive

**Current Challenges:**
- **High shipping costs**: ‚Çπ2,000-5,000 per order kills margins
- **Social media ads are expensive**: Spending $$$ just to stay top-of-mind
- **Zero US brand awareness**: Quality products invisible to diaspora buyers
- **Platform commoditization**: Amazon/eBay/Etsy bury your brand in generic listings
- **Individual marketing too costly**: Can't afford US customer acquisition alone
- **Discovery problem**: 100+ Indian baby brands exist, but customers only know 2-3

**The Reality:**
You have amazing products that diaspora families want, but they can't find you and you can't afford to reach them individually.

---

## Slide 3: What Diaspora Families Are Saying

### The demand is real - but fragmented

**Customer Pain Points:**
- "I want authentic Indian baby clothes but don't know which brands ship to the US"
- "I ask family visiting from India to bring baby items - it's so inconvenient"
- "I Google 'Indian baby clothes USA' and find scattered individual sites"
- "I want trusted, curated options, not random Amazon listings"

**The Insight:**
Indian Americans actively seek baby products from India but face a fragmented, frustrating shopping experience. They want a trusted platform to discover ALL the best Indian brands.

## Slide 14: FAQ - Your Questions Answered

### Common Questions from Brands

**Q: How is this different from Amazon or Etsy?**
A: We're curated (not commoditized), focused on Indian diaspora (not general marketplace), and built around brand storytelling (not price wars). Plus, you keep your Shopify operations - we just drive traffic.

**Q: Do I need to hold US inventory?**
A: No! Phase 1 is affiliate discovery. You ship from India as you do today. Phase 2 (after validation) will offer optional US fulfillment to reduce shipping times.

**Q: What about tariffs and import duties?**
A: Since brands ship directly, customers handle import duties at their end. Our affiliate model avoids wholesale import complexities. Plus, India-US trade agreements are expanding, creating tailwinds.

**Q: How do you drive traffic to my products?**
A: SEO (ranking for "Indian baby clothes USA"), content marketing (brand stories, buying guides), social media (Instagram/Facebook diaspora targeting), and community engagement (parenting groups).

**Q: What if my products don't sell?**
A: You pay zero fees. We learn what resonates with diaspora customers, adjust our approach, and iterate. No risk to you. We may suggest product variations based on customer feedback.

**Q: Can I sell on Amazon/Etsy while partnering with Mela?**
A: Absolutely! We're not exclusive. We're an additional channel, not a replacement for your existing sales channels.

**Q: How long until I see results?**
A: We're in validation phase. First 3 months focused on building brand presence and driving initial traffic. Realistic expectation: 10-50 orders in first 6 months as we scale customer acquisition.

**Q: What makes you different from other export platforms?**
A: We're building WITH you, not extracting FROM you. Performance-based means we invest in marketing, you invest in products. Equal partners, aligned incentives.

## Slide 17: Social Proof & Validation

### Early Signals Supporting This Model

**Customer Validation:**
- **Existing behavior**: Indian Americans already asking visitors to bring baby products from India
- **Search demand**: High volume for "Indian baby clothes USA", "ethnic baby wear"
- **Fragmented experience**: Customers want single trusted destination vs. hunting individual sites
- **Discovery gap**: 100+ brands exist but customers only know 2-3

**Brand Validation:**
- **Many brands already selling in US** but suffer from discovery problem
- **High social media acquisition costs**: Brands spending $$$ on ads just to stay top-of-mind
- **Margin pressure**: Individual brands can't efficiently reach diaspora customers
- **Export readiness**: Brands have Shopify, ship internationally, ready to scale

**Market Validation:**
- **Government tailwinds**: India-US $500B trade goal, EU-India FTA negotiations
- **Cross-border e-commerce boom**: Baby products = top category, $800B market by 2025
- **Diaspora demographic strength**: $126K median income, 200K+ babies annually
- **Zero direct competition**: No one owns curated Indian brand exports to diaspora
