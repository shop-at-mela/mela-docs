## Brand Partnership Deck

---

## Slide 1: Your Next Growth Market is Waiting

**Mela connects Indian baby fashion brands with diaspora families in the USA**

🚀 **Founding Partners Program**

### The Opportunity
- **4.5M Indian Americans** with $126K median household income
- **200K+ Indian babies born annually** in the US
- **Zero specialty retailers** for authentic Indian baby products

### Zero Risk Start
✨ No listing fees | 🎯 Ready customers | 📈 Performance-based

---

## Slide 2: The Problem You're Facing

### Selling to the US market is hard and expensive

**Current Challenges:**
- **High shipping costs**: ₹2,000-5,000 per order kills margins
- **Social media ads are expensive**: Spending $$$ just to stay top-of-mind
- **Zero US brand awareness**: Quality products invisible to diaspora buyers
- **Platform commoditization**: Amazon/eBay/Etsy bury your brand in generic listings
- **Individual marketing too costly**: Can't afford US customer acquisition alone
- **Discovery problem**: 100+ Indian baby brands exist, but customers only know 2-3

**The Reality:**
You have amazing products that diaspora families want, but they can't find you and you can't afford to reach them individually.

---

## Slide 3: What Diaspora Families Are Saying

### The demand is real - but fragmented

**Customer Pain Points:**
- "I want authentic Indian baby clothes but don't know which brands ship to the US"
- "I ask family visiting from India to bring baby items - it's so inconvenient"
- "I Google 'Indian baby clothes USA' and find scattered individual sites"
- "I want trusted, curated options, not random Amazon listings"

**The Insight:**
Indian Americans actively seek baby products from India but face a fragmented, frustrating shopping experience. They want a trusted platform to discover ALL the best Indian brands.

## Slide 14: FAQ - Your Questions Answered

### Common Questions from Brands

**Q: How is this different from Amazon or Etsy?**
A: We're curated (not commoditized), focused on Indian diaspora (not general marketplace), and built around brand storytelling (not price wars). Plus, you keep your Shopify operations - we just drive traffic.

**Q: Do I need to hold US inventory?**
A: No! Phase 1 is affiliate discovery. You ship from India as you do today. Phase 2 (after validation) will offer optional US fulfillment to reduce shipping times.

**Q: What about tariffs and import duties?**
A: Since brands ship directly, customers handle import duties at their end. Our affiliate model avoids wholesale import complexities. Plus, India-US trade agreements are expanding, creating tailwinds.

**Q: How do you drive traffic to my products?**
A: SEO (ranking for "Indian baby clothes USA"), content marketing (brand stories, buying guides), social media (Instagram/Facebook diaspora targeting), and community engagement (parenting groups).

**Q: What if my products don't sell?**
A: During MVP validation, you pay per qualified visit we send, not per sale. This means you get traffic regardless of conversion. We learn what resonates with diaspora customers, adjust our approach, and iterate. Post-validation, we shift to conversion-based commission. No risk to you.

**Q: Can I sell on Amazon/Etsy while partnering with Mela?**
A: Absolutely! We're not exclusive. We're an additional channel, not a replacement for your existing sales channels.

**Q: How long until I see results?**
A: We're in validation phase. First 3 months focused on building brand presence and driving initial traffic. Realistic expectation: 10-50 orders in first 6 months as we scale customer acquisition.

**Q: What makes you different from other export platforms?**
A: We're building WITH you, not extracting FROM you. Performance-based means we invest in marketing, you invest in products. Equal partners, aligned incentives.

## Slide 17: Social Proof & Validation

### Early Signals Supporting This Model

**Customer Validation:**
- **Existing behavior**: Indian Americans already asking visitors to bring baby products from India
- **Search demand**: High volume for "Indian baby clothes USA", "ethnic baby wear"
- **Fragmented experience**: Customers want single trusted destination vs. hunting individual sites
- **Discovery gap**: 100+ brands exist but customers only know 2-3

**Brand Validation:**
- **Many brands already selling in US** but suffer from discovery problem
- **High social media acquisition costs**: Brands spending $$$ on ads just to stay top-of-mind
- **Margin pressure**: Individual brands can't efficiently reach diaspora customers
- **Export readiness**: Brands have Shopify, ship internationally, ready to scale

**Market Validation:**
- **Government tailwinds**: India-US $500B trade goal, EU-India FTA negotiations
- **Cross-border e-commerce boom**: Baby products = top category, $800B market by 2025
- **Diaspora demographic strength**: $126K median income, 200K+ babies annually
- **Zero direct competition**: No one owns curated Indian brand exports to diaspora
