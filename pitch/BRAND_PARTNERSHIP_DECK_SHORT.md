# Partner with Mela - Sell to US Diaspora Families
## Brand Partnership Deck (8 Slides)

---

## Slide 1: Your US Market Opportunity

**Sell your Indian baby products to 4.5M Indian American families**

### The Market Waiting for You
- **4.5M Indian Americans** with $126K median household income
- **200K+ Indian babies born annually** in the US
- **Zero specialty retailers** for authentic Indian products
- **High demand**: Families already asking visitors to bring baby items from India

### Zero-Risk Partnership
✨ **No listing fees** | 🎯 **Ready customers** | 📈 **2-5% commission only**

**Start selling in 2 weeks with zero upfront investment**

---

## Slide 2: The Problem You're Solving

### Current Challenges for Indian Brands
❌ **High shipping costs**: ₹2,000-5,000 per order kills margins
❌ **Expensive ads**: Spending $$$ on social media just to stay visible
❌ **Zero US awareness**: Quality products invisible to diaspora buyers
❌ **Platform commoditization**: Amazon/eBay/Etsy bury brands in generic listings
❌ **Discovery gap**: 100+ brands exist, customers know only 2-3

### What Diaspora Families Say
💬 "I want authentic Indian baby clothes but don't know which brands ship to US"
💬 "I ask family visiting from India to bring baby items - so inconvenient"
💬 "I want trusted curation, not random Amazon listings"

**The gap: You have products they want. They can't find you. You can't afford to reach them.**
