## Slide 2: The Problem - Indian Brands Face Export Barriers

### Indian D2C brands have proven product-market fit domestically but struggle to go global

**Current Pain Points:**
- **Zero US market awareness**: Quality products invisible to global buyers
- **Platform commoditization**: Amazon/eBay/Etsy bury brand stories in generic listings
- **Individual marketing too costly**: Each brand can't afford US customer acquisition alone
- **Complex market entry**: Payments, logistics (forward shipping, ₹2,000+ per order kills margins), trust barriers block expansion

**The Gap:**
Indian brands excel at quality and customer service domestically but lack infrastructure to scale globally.

## Slide 3: The Opportunity - Indian Diaspora Demand

### 4.5M Indian Americans (+ their social connections) seeking cultural connection through authentic products

**Market Fundamentals:**
- **4.5M Indian Americans** with $126K median household income (vs. $70K US average)
- **200K+ Indian babies born annually** in the US
- **Premium pricing acceptance**: 2-3x willingness to pay for quality + cultural authenticity
- **Zero specialty retailers** for authentic Indian baby products in US market
- **Proven search demand**: High volume for "Indian baby clothes USA", "ethnic baby wear"

**The Insight:**
Diaspora families want authentic Indian products but face fragmented shopping experiences across individual brand sites. They seek trusted curation in one place.

**Cross-Border E-Commerce Tailwinds:**
- **Baby products = top category**: Baby supplies among leading categories for cross-border e-commerce
- **Market growth**: Global cross-border e-commerce growing to $800B by 2025, $2T by 2030
- **India export push**: Government targeting $1T merchandise exports by 2030; e-commerce as key driver

---

## Slide 4: The Hypothesis - We're Early in Validation

### Two critical assumptions we're testing:

**Hypothesis 1: Supply Side**
Indian brands (starting with baby fashion) want to participate in an export-only marketplace vs. managing exports independently

**Early Signals:**
- **Many brands already selling in US** but suffer from discovery problem
- **High social media acquisition costs**: Brands spending $$$ on ads just to stay top-of-mind
- **Margin pressure**: Individual brands can't efficiently reach diaspora customers
- Need for 10+ brand commitments to validate marketplace value

**Hypothesis 2: Demand Side**
Western consumers (starting with Indian diaspora) prefer a curated marketplace of Indian brands vs. visiting individual Shopify sites

**Early Signals:**
- **Low brand awareness**: Friends and friends-of-friends not aware of many brands selling in US
- **Discovery gap**: 100+ brands exist but customers only know 2-3
- **Fragmented experience**: Customers want single trusted destination vs. hunting individual sites
- Conversion metrics and user feedback will validate unified marketplace value

**Current Stage:** Early validation - seeking brand commitments and customer feedback

## Slide 6: Why Start with Baby Fashion?

## Slide 10: Why Now? Market Timing Advantage

### Uncertainty creates first-mover opportunity + Massive trade tailwinds

**Massive Trade Expansion Underway:**
- **India-US**: $500B trade goal by 2030 (from $191B currently); US is India's #1 trading partner at $131.84B in FY25
- **India-Europe**: EU-India FTA negotiations ongoing; trade grew 90% over past decade to €120B
- **India-EFTA**: $100B investment commitment over 15 years (signed March 2024)
- **Export targets**: India targeting $1 trillion in merchandise exports by 2030 (12.2% CAGR)
- **Government backing**: All major markets committed to deepening India trade ties

**Warren Buffett Wisdom:**
"Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful"

**Current Environment:**

- **Global platform resilience**: Multi-market expansion (Europe 2026+, Middle East 2026+, Australia 2027+) reduces single-country policy risk

**First-Mover Advantages:**
- **NOW**: Opportunity window - limited competition, maximum attention, government tailwinds
- **6-12 months**: Market stabilization - more players enter
- **1-2 years**: Saturated market - established players dominate
