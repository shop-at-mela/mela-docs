## Slide 2: Problem ‚Üí Solution

### The Problem
**Brands:** Discovery gap - 100+ brands exist, customers know only 2-3. High social media ad costs, can't afford individual US marketing.

**Customers:** Want authentic Indian baby products but face fragmented experience across individual Shopify sites. No trusted curation.

- SEO (ranking for "Indian baby clothes USA")
- Content marketing (brand stories, festival campaigns)
- Targeted diaspora social media

**Brands keep operations, we drive customers. 2-5% commission only on completed sales.**

## Slide 6: Competitive Advantage

### No Direct Competitor Owns Curated Indian Brand Exports

| Competitor | Their Approach | Mela's Advantage |
|------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Amazon/eBay/Etsy** | Commoditized, price wars | Brand storytelling, curated premium |
| **Individual Brands** | Solo Shopify, expensive ads | Unified discovery, shared marketing |
| **India E-commerce** | High shipping (‚Çπ2,000+/order) | Affiliate model (brands ship direct) |

### Differentiation
- **Export-first focus**: Built for cross-border Indian brands
- **Performance-based**: 2-5% vs. Amazon 15% / eBay 12-15%
- **Category expertise**: Baby fashion depth, not broad/shallow
- **Partnership model**: Co-build vs. extract value
- **Cultural curation**: Diaspora preferences, not general market

## Slide 7: The Ask

### Seeking: Expert Guidance to Validate Hypothesis

**What We Need:**
- **Brand introductions**: Help onboarding baby clothing, shoes, accessories brands
- **Industry connections**: Access to Indian D2C brand networks
- **Strategic guidance**: Feedback on partnership model and value prop
- **Legal guidance**: Content licensing, affiliate agreements
- **Angel/pre-seed support**: For those interested in validation phase

**Why Now Matters:**
- Need 10+ brand commitments to prove supply-side hypothesis

- Each successful brand refers others (network effects)

### 6-Month Success

## Slide 8: Vision - Platform Indian Brands Deserve

### Short-term (2-3 years)
- Leading export marketplace for Indian baby brands
- 100+ partners across multiple categories
- Active in 3+ markets (US, Europe, Middle East)
- Profitable unit economics

### Long-term (5+ years)
- Default platform for Indian brands going global
- 500+ brands across 10+ categories
- Present in 10+ countries
- Enabling Indian D2C brands to compete globally

### Why This Matters
Indian brands create world-class products but lack global visibility. Diaspora communities crave authentic cultural connection. E-commerce enables cultural exchange at scale. Performance-based model democratizes market access.

**We're building the platform that Indian brands deserve to scale globally.**
